### Effective Rust
- ecomomy das somporka jana
- acual problem slove kora like cleaning, gardaning or food production real time data collection
- provide scolorly education through imagination, aware and through vul kora. so that awareness can be flow into action
- knowleged/data management and reprasentation. hardware level OS. (when learning exect what you need)
- creating businesses/corporations.

make it relevent

first prenciple thinking to anything. (~~creating. wander~~) start it programming throuh gaming. to do: read a book in "book about different fields first principle" sence-fic to different subject books. 

**mulipule skill building just for fun. demistify things just for fun. see if it works, this skill works as they say it will. coding/tech books to bussiness (tech-2-realWorld) to biografy to since-friction. just for fun.** 

for practice:
Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done.

Speed Learning: Learn In Half The Time:
Active learning: Questioning
mamorey and emotion: aligns with the broader context
Forget: Start with a beginner's mind and forget preconceived notions of what you know.
Clear distractions to fully engage with the learning material.
trained or untrained
~~the faster you learn the faster you earn.~~
relaxed stage is most optimal for learning

to do:
- at least one elon vidoe a day. for my re-birth.
- OS building logic information I need to cover.

Use Rust's type system to express your design, your program values. All of the values, all of the data that your prgram will operate on.
1. Use the type system to express your data structures
2. Use the type system to express common behavior

it's just implementation ditals, code acha, code ka just bu-j-ba
I need momantume.
it's all about desinging and knowing instractions.

for new things fun creativety lagba and when you know fimilier things that's focus mode. autopilate interactive ingaging video game. immerse. just being as immersed in the thing as possible.
here is the project, I'm gonna do this thing, this concept is for this (when I'm gonna use this thing) (need for right now)
