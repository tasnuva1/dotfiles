# Islam: 
we created suff from that is already there.

To start worshiping this one god as he wants to be worshiped, he will not leave me alone. he will not let me down. that doesn't mean that there won't be any obstacle or difficultiest in life. But he won't let me down. you can take a wrong decision regarding your job or even your marriage reqarding many thing in life. But here ""we are talking about eternity" what makes more sense to worry about, a future of 80 years or a future of 80 billion years. Make it simplified: crafting, 0 to 1, Mansur/Islam. [focul point] You still feel something inside your heart, "Okay, I can handle it." emotions you can get from anything, from seeing people watching a football game to anything. emotion in and of itself do not mean too much. 
right now: 1 hour effiective system/system stuff.

# English:
## Textbook vs native:
I do not understand what you're saying.
I'm not following you.

I need to leave now.
I gotta go right now.
or I should get going. 

This makes me feel so angry.
This pisses me off.

I'm so tired.
I'm dead.

Yes, I agree with that.
definately.
